Big Description - In the ever competitive business world, building both professional and personal connections is vital. Some people are natural networkers and can easily build connections; however, others find it hard and uncomfortable. No matter which category one falls into, it is our groupâ€™s intent to create a group that facilitates and promotes the building of professional relationships. On Par Connections looks to accomplish this by facilitating both formal and leisure events, at these events we will bring students and business professionals together. Our focus will be around golf outings and an annual golf tournament, but we will also host other activities such as dinners, meet and greets, etc.
