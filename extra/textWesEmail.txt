Goal - Our goal as On Par Connections is to create a strong and successful networking environment to help students of the MSU College of Business create professional relationships with employers in their future fields of work. 

Big Description - In the ever competitive business world, building both professional and personal connections is vital. Some people are natural networkers and can easily build connections; however, others find it hard and uncomfortable. No matter which category one falls into, it is our groupâ€™s intent to create a group that facilitates and promotes the building of professional relationships. On Par Connections looks to accomplish this by facilitating both formal and leisure events, at these events we will bring students and business professionals together. Our focus will be around golf outings and an annual golf tournament, but we will also host other activities such as dinners, meet and greets, etc.

We can do more after this, but I think this is a great start! I appreciate the help and email me with any questions!
